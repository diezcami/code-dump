# Code Dump
This repository stores a small fraction of code snippets I've written over the years. I've written most of them while learning new programming languages or concepts, so you'll probably find a number of awkward coding practices here and there. Please don't judge me too much ðŸ˜­ 

Branches in this repo are organized by year, and each branch includes code snippets categorised by the language they were written in.
